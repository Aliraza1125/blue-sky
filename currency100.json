    "description": "<p>Bitcoin is the first digital currency that allows users to send and receive money, without the interference of a central bank or government. Instead, a network of thousands of peers is controlling the transactions; a decentralized system.</p>\n\n<h3>Why does bitcoin have value?</h3>\n\n<p>Bitcoin&rsquo;s useful qualities (decentralized, borderless, secure) aren&rsquo;t the only reason the coin is worth so much. Due to its scarcity (and it&rsquo;s hard to produce), Bitcoin is often nicknamed &lsquo;Digital Gold&rsquo;, in reference to &lsquo;classic&rsquo; physical gold. Like gold, Bitcoin also has a finite supply of coins available; there will only ever be 21 million bitcoin. And now you know why the creation of new bitcoins is also called mining.</p>\n\n<h3>No inflation in bitcoin</h3>\n\n<p>Bitcoin was invented in response to a few concerns the inventor(s) had, such as inflation. Its supply is limited, so one cannot just devalue the currency by printing more, as governments often do with fiat currencies (USD, EUR, etc.).</p>\n\n<p>As people look for alternative places to keep their money rather than losing value in a negative interest rate account, Bitcoin becomes more appealing. Big global companies, such as Tesla and MicroStrategy already purchased serious amounts of Bitcoin. And it&#39;s only a matter of time that other companies will follow. This also ensures that the value remains or continues to increase.</p>\n\n<h3>Who built Bitcoin</h3>\n\n<p>In 2008, Bitcoin was invented by an anonymous person or group named Satoshi Nakamoto. In 2009, Bitcoin was released as open-source software. Nakamoto&rsquo;s real identity is still unknown, although there are many theories about who it might be. Decentralization is one of Bitcoin&rsquo;s most important principles, and that&rsquo;s why this anonymity is perfectly in line.</p>\n\n<h3>The technology of Bitcoin</h3>\n\n<p>The Bitcoin blockchain is a database, the so-called &lsquo;ledger&rsquo;, that consists of bitcoin transaction records. For new transactions to be added to the ledger, the nodes must agree that the transaction is real and valid. The blockchain is public and contains records of all the transactions taking place.</p>\n\n<h3>How to buy bitcoin?</h3>\n\n<p>Continue reading <a href=\"https://coinranking.com/blog/how-to-buy-your-first-bitcoin/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">this blog article</a> on how to buy your first bitcoin.</p>\n",

It allows developers to deploy all sorts of decentralized applications (Dapps), without the interference of third parties. Ethereum is also used for its own cryptocurrency ether. Ethereum is now the world&rsquo;s second-most valued cryptocurrency platform.</p>\n\n<h3>The goal of Ethereum</h3>\n\n<p>Ethereum is created as a blockchain platform on which other applications could be built on top of. Most of the online services, businesses and enterprises are built on a centralized system of governance. Ethereum aims to decentralize the existing client-server model; servers and clouds are replaced by so-called nodes, run by volunteers from all over the world. Ethereum&rsquo;s vision is that it would enable this same functionality to people anywhere around the world, enabling them to compete to offer services on top of this infrastructure.</p>\n\n<h3>Who built Ethereum</h3>\n\n<p>Ethereum was initially described in a white paper by Vitalik Buterin. In 2014, Buterin and the other co-founders launched a campaign where they sold ether (Ethereum tokens) to raise money to build their vision. Since the launch of the white paper in 2015, the platform has grown fast, and these days there are hundreds of developers involved.</p>\n",

    "description": "<p>Solana&nbsp;is a high-performance cryptocurrency blockchain which supports smart contracts and decentralized applications. It uses a proof of stake consensus mechanism with a low barrier to entry along with timestamped transactions to maximize efficiency.This allows Solana to process 50-65 000 transactions per second with a theoretical limit of over 700 00 transactions per second (compared to Bitcoin&rsquo;s 7 TPS and Ethereum&rsquo;s 15 TPS). In contrast to other similar projects such as&nbsp;Polkadot.<br />\nThe team at Solana has designed their blockchain with a long-term vision in mind. This comes from founder Anatoly Yakovenko&rsquo;s own experience watching telecommunications technologies almost double in capability every year during his time at Qualcomm.<br />\nSolana is developed by a company of the same name which is based in San Diego, California. The Solana team consists of former Qualcomm, Google, Apple, Microsoft, and Dropbox employees. In addition to being based on similar database technologies used by Google and Microsoft, Solana&rsquo;s architecture is also inspired by&nbsp;Filecoin, a decentralized data storage cryptocurrency project.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>How does Solana Work?</strong><br />\n<br />\nDisclaimer: Solana is incredibly complex. Start with a term you may have heard if you have looked at the project before:&nbsp;Proof of History&nbsp;(PoH). PoH is not a consensus mechanism. Rather, it is a component in Solana&rsquo;s Proof of Stake consensus. PoH involves timestamping transactions when they are added to a Solana block. A new block on Solana is generated every 400ms (compared to Ethereum&rsquo;s roughly 15 seconds and Bitcoin&rsquo;s 10 minutes).Without getting into too much detail, the&nbsp;decentralized clock&nbsp;which is used as reference for the timestamps is the SHA256 hash function. SHA256 may sound familiar because it is used in Bitcoin&rsquo;s Proof of Work consensus mechanism. However, instead of working to &ldquo;solve&rdquo; the hash functions to produce a new block, Solana instead uses SHA256&rsquo;s repetitive outputs as reference &ndash; timestamps. This produces a sort of &ldquo;clock tick&rdquo; where each clock tick is 400ms (instead of one second like a regular clock).<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n",

The HEX smart contract penalizes stakers for ending their stake early and rewards them for staking larger amounts of HEX for longer periods. HEX is distributed to Bitcoin holders by way of a snapshot of the Bitcoin UTXO set that occurred on 2 December 2019 at block height 606227. The distribution of HEX to Bitcoin holders is 10,000 HEX per 1 BTC. Bitcoin holders are able to claim HEX only during the first year of launch. During this period, HEX is also obtained in exchange for ETH through interacting with the HEX smart contract. At the end of the first year of launch, all HEX coins that were not claimed by Bitcoin holders are distributed to the rest of the HEX users who have stakes that are active. The maximum possible annual inflation of HEX is designed to be 3.69% after the first year of launch.</p>",

It’s an electronic cash platform that allows peer-to-peer online cash payments to be made without the clearance of a clearinghouse. One of the most pressing issues for bitcoin has always been its scalability; the size of a block of transactions was limited to one MB. Bitcoin Cash was initiated to increase this block size.</p>\n<h3>The goal of Bitcoin Cash</h3>\n<p>Bitcoin cash is very similar to bitcoin and also used as a payment system. Bitcoin Cash allows faster transaction times and lower transaction fees; it enabled the increase of the block size from one MB to eight MB. Its overall goal is to increase the number of transactions that can be processed by the network.</p>\n<h3>Who started Bitcoin Cash</h3>\n<p>Bitcoin Cash was officially released in August 2017, as a result of a discussion about the scalability of Bitcoin; the community had some concerns about Bitcoin’s ability to process the large number of transactions on the Bitcoin network. Looking for a solution, the community was divided into two groups. Unable to find a compromise, a hard fork was implemented, and Bitcoin Cash was created.</p>",

It differs from Bitcoin&#39;s in a few key ways, but is very similar to Bitcoin: it&rsquo;s an anonymous version of Bitcoin. It can be used to buy and sell things, and be exchanged for other coins or tokens.</p>\n\n<h3>The goal of Monero</h3>\n\n<p>The privacy features of Monero gives it its most value. No one can link Monero cryptocurrency transactions to a person. Monero is also created for its fungibility, all Monero coins are identical and mutually interchangeable. Monero has dynamic scalability, which means it has no &ldquo;pre-set&rdquo; block size limit. Monero has ASIC resistance and multiple keys.</p>\n\n<h3>Who started Monero</h3>\n\n<p>Bytecoin, launched in 2012, was the precursor of Monero. It was the first digital currency that was written using a technology called CryptoNote. CryptoNote is the spine of most of the privacy-based cryptocurrencies that exist, including Monero. However, there were a few issues with Bytecoin, which lead to a group of seven developers to fork the Bytecoin blockchain. The new currency would be known as Bitmonero, later named Monero. Five of the seven developers decided to stay anonymous. Only two of these Monero developers are known: Riccardo Spagni and David Latapie.</p>\n",

It’s designed so all the world’s financial systems can work together on a single network. With this financial system they fight poverty and help develop individual potential. Stellar is useful and valuable because it is capable of hosting thousands of exchanges between currencies and tokens per second.</p>\n<h3>Who started Stellar</h3>\n<p>In 2014, Jed McCaleb, founder of Mt. Gox and co-founder of Ripple, launched the network system Stellar with former lawyer Joyce Kim. The nonprofit Stellar Development Foundation was created in collaboration with Stripe CEO Patrick Collison, later in 2014. This foundation employs technologists, scientists, designers, and businesspeople, all dedicated to building a more inclusive global marketplace. Their goal is to unlock the world’s economic potential by making money more fluid and people more empowered.</p>",

Also, the platform aims to boost the security of smart contracts through formal verification of code. The creators of Tezos believe that a decentralized system must be decentralized at all levels; all the decisions must be taken decentralized, especially the proposals to improve or change the project.</p>\n\n<h3>The goal of Tezos</h3>\n\n<p>Tezos focusses on three main issues; smart contract safety, long-term upgradability, and open participation. Tezos is designed to provide the code correctness and safety that is necessary for assets and other important use cases. Tezos has a so-called modular architecture, which refers to the design of a system composed of separate components that can be connected together. Together with its formal upgrade mechanism, Tezos&rsquo; allows the network to adopt and propose innovations very smoothly. All stakeholders may participate in network upgrades by evaluating, proposing, or approving changes.</p>\n\n<h3>Who started Tezos</h3>\n\n<p>Since 2014, co-founders (while being a couple) Arthur Breitman and Kathleen Breitman, have been developing Tezos with a core group of developers. In 2017, the Tezos Foundation headquartered in Switzerland raised $232 million in just two weeks in a fundraiser. It became one of the biggest ICOs.</p>\n",

Transactions on its proof of work blockchain are untraceable because of zero-knowledge cryptography. It was created in response to, their words, bitcoin&rsquo;s flaws. It uses the same algorithm as bitcoin but then in combination with semi-transparent processing, to avoid the transparency of bitcoin. The user transaction data is revealed selectively.</p>\n\n<h3>The goal of ZCash</h3>\n\n<p>Zcash is developed to overcome bitcoin&rsquo;s privacy &ldquo;flaws&rdquo; and uses zero-knowledge proofs to verify and validate transactions. ZCash&rsquo;s blockchain aims to provide practical utility for businesses and large organizations interested in systems that combine the benefits of blockchain technology with privacy.</p>\n\n<h3>Who started ZCash</h3>\n\n<p>In 2016, ZCash was founded by Zooko Wilcox-O&rsquo;Hearn in response to demands for an open financial system with added privacy features. Zcash&rsquo;s roots lie in Zerocoin, which was developed in the 1980s; ZCash was initially launched as Zerocash back in 2014.</p>\n",

It is a smart contract platform that controls and sells Dai; Maker stabilizes the value of Dai to one U.S. dollar using external market mechanisms and economic incentives. Without the need of using a third centralized party, Maker aims to offer a transparent stablecoin system that is operating on the Ethereum blockchain. The Maker Platform has two coins: Makercoin (MKR) and Dai (DAI); Dai is a stable coin that is used for payments, savings, or collateral.</p>\n<h3>The goal of Maker</h3>\n<p>Maker has three important functions on the Maker Platform. The first is utility; you can only use Maker to pay the fees accumulated on Customer Data Platforms (CPDs) that generate Dai in the Maker system. When someone pays a fee, a Maker coin is burned from the supply, which will then decrease. The second function is governance; holders use Maker to vote for the risk management and logistics of the Maker system. And the third is recapitalization resource. If parts of the collateral portfolio become under-collateralized, the system immediately creates new Maker tokens and sells them. This gains money to capitalize the shortfall of value in the system and brings the entire Maker system back from insolvency.</p>",

Dash describes itself as portable, inexpensive, divisible, and fast digital cash for both the internet and everyday life. Dash is an open protocol not under the control of any single entity. Anyone can write software to transact on the Dash network without requiring the permission of a central authority. Dash only asks a small fee to prevent spam attacks.</p>\n<h3>The goal of Dash</h3>\n<p>Dash is used around the world as a practical alternative to cash and credit cards, low fees and fast transactions. It is also meant as s solution in the international remittances market. It is particularly popular in regions where technical access barriers exist to traditional payment systems, or where hyperinflation has made existing currency impractical to use.</p>\n<h3>Who started Dash</h3>\n<p>Dash was launched in 2014 by founder Evan Duffield. The project is based on the Bitcoin project, mainly focussing on speed and fungibility. It aims to be a practical alternative to cash, both online and at the point of sale in shops and restaurants.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Basic Attention Token (BAT) is an ERC-20 token built on top of Ethereum. This utility token aims to improve the digital advertising industry. They will achieve this by creating a decentralized ad exchange where publishers will be paid for their content and users for their attention, while providing advertisers with less expensive customer attention, less fraud, and better attribution. Users can also donate BAT back to publishers or use them on the platform.</p>\n<h3>The goal of Basic Attention Token</h3>\n<p>According to the BAT team, digital advertising is broken: “It is a market filled with middlemen and fraudsters, hurting users, publishers and advertisers.” Basic Attention Token was created to improve this. The transparent system wants to keep user data private while delivering less, and at the same time more relevant ads. Publishers experience less fraud while increasing their percentage of rewards. And advertisers get better reporting and performance. The Brave browser is a fast, open source, privacy-focused browser that blocks ads and trackers, and contains a ledger system that anonymously measures user attention, which helps to reward the publishers.</p>\n<h3>Who started Basic Attention Token</h3>\n<p>Basic Attention Token was created by the co-founder of Mozilla and Firefox, along with the creator of JavaScript. The ICO of Basic Attention Token (BAT) started in May 2017.</p>",
